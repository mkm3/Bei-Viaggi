## About
Hackbright Academy - Prep Course Final Project - January 2020 

This was my first coding project and done purely in Python. A virtual travel quiz where the user goes through a series of questions to find out a recommended travel destination. Feel free to download my travel quiz to try it out [here](https://Prep-Course-Final-Project.macaraegm.repl.run). Enjoy!
