# Bei Viaggi

## About
Hackbright Academy - Prep Course Final Project - January 2020 

This was my first coding project and done purely in Python. Bei Viaggi is a virtual travel quiz where the user goes through a series of questions to receive a recommended travel destination. Feel free to clone/fork my travel quiz to try it out. Enjoy!
